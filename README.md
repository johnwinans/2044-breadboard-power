Power supply for a breadboard.

These are the source files for a KiCad project featured in a tutorial here:

If you want to make one of these for yourself you can use this design as
it is or and alter it and make it better.  (I havn't tested this design
yet.  But I have ordered some and will do so soon.  At that point
I will update this 'warning'.)

If you just want one, see the PDF file for the digikey order IDs of the parts
and here is a place where you can order 3 of these (bare boards) for $7.10 
including shipping (I don't get a penny of that by the way.  
I just think it is a decent deal):
