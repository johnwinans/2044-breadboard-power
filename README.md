If you want to make one of these for yourself you can use this design as
it is or and alter it and make it better.  

If you just want one, see the PDF file for the digikey order IDs of the parts
and here is a place where you can order 3 of these (bare boards) for $6.30 
including shipping (I don't get a penny of that by the way.  I just think it 
is a decent deal):
